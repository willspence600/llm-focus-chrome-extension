Surely, Ludwig van Beethoven but I suppose it is subjective? It seems every talented virtuoso who (impudently?) took him on was thrashed and humiliated. It was never merely a points win; each occasion emphasised Beethoven's absolute supremacy. That was of course in a contemporary sense. What of others who followed? I wonder what Beethoven's thoughts would have been on say Chopin, the 'poet of the keyboard'?

Hmm...I wonder what Beethoven would of thought of Liszt, or Rachmaninoff?

Anyway, Liszt gets me vote, not only because of his virtuosity but because of his dedication to the arts and his selfless promotion of his contemporaries. His concerts are at the top of my "wish I was there" list.

Check this out...

Franz Liszt in 1875 said:
'I was about eleven years of age when my venerated teacher Czerny took me to Beethoven. He had told the latter about me a long time before, and had begged him to listen to me play some time. Yet Beethoven had such a repugnance to infant prodigies that he had always violently objected to receiving me. Finally, however, he allowed himself to be persuaded by the indefatigable Czerny, and in the end cried impatiently. "In God's name, then, bring me the young Turk!" It was ten o'clock in the morning when we entered the two small rooms in the Schwarzspanierhaus [Liszt made a mistake in the address, since in April 1823 Beethoven was living at Oberepfarrgasse 60, Kothgasse] which Beethoven occupied; I somewhat shyly, Czerny amiably encouraging me. Beethoven was working at a long, narrow table by the window. He looked gloomily at us for a time, said a few brief words to Czerny and remained silent when my kind teacher beckoned me to the piano. I first played a short piece by Ries. When I had finished Beethoven asked me whether I could play a Bach fugue. I chose the C minor Fugue from the Well Tempered Clavier. "And could you also transpose the Fugue at once into another key?" Beethoven asked me.

Fortunately I was able to do so. After my closing chord I glanced up. The great Master's darkly glowing gaze lay piercingly upon me. Yet suddenly a gentle smile passed over the gloomy features, and Beethoven came quite close to me, stooped down, put his hand on my head, and stroked my hair several times." A devil of a fellow," he whispered, "a regular young Turk!" Suddenly I felt quite brave. "May I play something of yours now?" I boldly asked. Beethoven smiled and nodded. I played the first movement of the C major Concerto. When I had concluded Beethoven caught hold of me with both hands, kissed me on the forehead and said gently. "Go! You are one of the fortunate ones! For you will give joy and happiness to many other people! There is nothing better or finer!". This event in my life has remained my greatest pride - the palladium of my whole career as an artist.'

It's impossible for us to know just how good those guys were for the very obvious reason that there aren't any recordings. All we have are comments from contemporaries. I mean, I'm sure Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt and the rest of them were great, but we can only imagine.... Maybe it's sacrilege to say so, but I wouldn't be surprised if people like Horowitz, Richter, Argerich and so on were/are even a bit better than them because they only need(ed) to focus on the piano while those composers also had to spend a lot of time doing other things. But we will never know...

Well in the case of Liszt, we have many transcriptions and etudes that are still impossibly hard to play. There have been comments about him taking very difficult passages in octaves, and other acrobatics which must of been amazing to witness.

Ludwig Van Beethoven was surely a great pianist, but certainly not THE greatest.

The problem with the general question "Who is the greatest _ of all time?" is that the standards for eras over time are all different. For example, Paganini was the violin god of his day, but if you put him in our day, he would be considered a super-virtuoso hack.

Another thing to consider is that the ideals of pianism have changed radically especially between the 18th-19th centuries, and 19th-20th centuries. The second of these movements showed a drastic shift from romantic pianism to intellectual pianism. The romantics allowed for loose rhythm (excessive rubato), unfaithfulness to the score, personal embellishment (Liszt would only play the piece as written when he first sight-read it), and other things that would be considered unacceptable in this day. Moreover, concert transcriptions , paraphrases, and salon music (Liszt, Thalberg, Gottshalk, Henselt) were preferred over much of the standard repertoire we see today (of course Chopin got ridiciously popular between the 19th-20th centuries though- I was thinking more on the line of Haydn, Mozart, Liszt's good stuff, a lot of Beethoven, Schubert...).

Of course there have always been exceptions. Clara Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Ignaz Moscheles despised the romantic era OF PIANISM and worked to counter-act it. Romantic pianists dominated the 1st third of the 20th century and continued to work into it: We see Liszt and Leschetizky such as Paderewski, Rosenthal, Friedman, and Moseiwitsch as well as others: Cortot, Horowitz (who died in 1989, well into the era of the modern school.)

And then we have more problems. First of all, the credibility of our "original" sources. Adolf von Henselt has always been considered one of the greatest pianists of all time, yet he was too nervous to perform in public. This claim is only credited by a few primary sources, but many experts believe that it is enough to be credible. However,we all know too well that primary sources cannot be trusted, especially in the form of romantic inventions.

A fact like this can be assumed only after there is a substantial amount of evidence for it, and there are some pianists who can claim this: Clementi, Mozart, Beethoven, Hummel, Kalbrenner, Moscheles, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Thalberg, Henselt, Herz, C.Schumann, Anton Rubinstein, Tausig, D'Albert, Godowsky, Busoni, Hofmann, Rachmaninoff, Cortot, Moseiwitsch, Artur Rubinstein, Richter, Horowitz...

It is all very subjective: Pianists like Dreyshock had amazing technical abilities (Rev. etude with left hand octaves) but were considered shallow even in their day; Chopin did not have sufficient power yet he had a handful of qualities that even Liszt envied; Alkan could of well been a great pianist, but he was eccentric, and ignored in his day; Anton Rubinstein, much like Beethoven, had demonic power and perhaps unmatched expression...

The general consensus seems to be Franz Liszt, and it is almost hard to disagree with that.

In fact, it's too easy to disagree with. None of us have ever heard Franz Liszt. That alone derails the entire proposition for putting him in the top spot.

What about Marc-Andre Hamelin or Martha Argerich or Vladimir Horowitz? Sviatoslav Richter? They seem pretty top-notch, and we're all well able to listen to them play.

I'd put my money on today's pianists, Argerich, Kissin, or Schiff simply because we have so much larger population than in the 19th century. We should have a lot more chances for really high achievers. I must have faith they learned their craft through determination and not through being whipped into it.

[ETA: I now remember the stories Beethoven's alleged whippings by his father may be unfounded, just part of the Beethoven myth. It all depends on which biography you read.]

Good statistical reasoning :)
I would be tempted to go with Liszt but I think you are right Weston.

I have never before heard the suggestion that LvB was one of history's greatest pianists. I'm sure he was extremely good but "best ever" doesn't sound right to me. Based on reputation only (ie before sound recording) the greatest pianist ever is reckoned to be Liszt. Another contender is Clara Schumann, who incidentally couldn't stand Liszt because of the latter's very flashy style. Alkan was also reckoned to be a very impressive pianist.

Among the greatest 20 th Century pianists the likes of Rachmaninoff, Hoffman, Schnabel, Arrau, Cortot, Horowitz, Bronfman, Rubinstein, Richter, Michelangeli, are ones who are normally mentioned as forming the top tier. Which of these was "best" is highly debatable because each was especially good with regard to certain composers. For example, Schnabel is usually associated with Beethoven, Richter with Schumann, and both Cortot and Rubinstein with Chopin. I would pick out Rubinstein as my top runner, partly because the sound quality of his recorded legacy is very high, and I happen to prefer those composers in which he excelled.

Other stars include Gould, Argerich, Hamelin, Brendel, Ciccolini, Kissin, Ashkenazy, Wilhelm Kempf, Alicia De Larrocha. The list is almost endless. Some reckon that Hamelin is technically the most perfect of the whole lot. Others rate Argerich very highly. For me, the best of the lot here is Brendel, who retired recently. I regard him as the best all-rounder; his playing of Schubert is unrivalled as far as I'm concerned, except possibly for Richter.

The fact that there are no recordings of the 19th century greats like Liszt, Chopin etc shouldn't be detrimental to their status. There are plenty of recordings of guys like Richter, Horowitz, Brendel, Arrau, Rubinstein, Gould etc yet no concensus on the greatest among them can be reached, so I believe eye witness or more correctly ear witness accounts by credible sources are just as valuable.

There are some names that automatically come up when one thinks of the greatest on a particular instrument.

Violin - Paganini
Classical Guitar - Segovia
Electric Guitar - Hendrix
Saxophone - Charlie Parker
Harmonica - Little Walter

And for piano it's nearly always between Liszt and Chopin. This however may be due to their status as piano composers and not strictly on their piano playing abilities, but surely composition for an instrument one plays should be taken into consideration.

Anyway, a question for the pianists. How do the jazz greats like Art Tatum, Bud Powell, Keith Jarrett etc compare to the great classicists. Here's a quote apparently from Sergei Rachmaninoff on Art Tatum :'he has better technique than any other living pianist, and may be the greatest ever'. Horowitz, Godowsky, Rubinstein and Gershwin were all supposed be amazed by Tatum's genius on the piano.

Nobody's mentioned Bizet yet.

At least Liszt liked him: "Liszt proclaimed that Bizet was one of the three finest pianists in Europe." (Wikipedia)

There's no way pianists from the 19th century can be a match for those from the 20th century; it took a long time before we could get pianists skillfully enough to play Schubert's late sonata or Beeethoven's Hammerklavier (I quote from its wikipedia article: "The work, particularly the last movement, had more or less to wait until the twentieth century before its significance was realised (possibly due to the difficulty of gaining a technically competent performance). Even as progressive a musician as Wagner, who appreciated the work and fully admired the late string quartets, held reservations for what he perceived as a lack of succinctness in its composition.") So Beethoven is unlikely to have the skill level of Brendel or Pollini.

Schubert wrote three late piano sonatas, Nos 19, 20, 21 which were completed more or less together, only a couple of months before he died in November 1828. They are known as his "last sonatas". The sonata before those, No 18, was completed two years earlier in October 1826.

These "last sonatas" were not published until about 10 years after the composer's death. The main reason why they were not played much during the 19th Century had nothing to do with their difficulty or playability but was because they were not considered to be all that significant works by Schubert. In other respects, however, his fame grew considerably during the 19th C. Regarding the piano sonatas, by the late 20th/early 21st century the old attitude changed considerably and they (along with several other sonatas) are now highly esteemed masterpieces by Schubert.

I'd even venture to say he was better than Liszt. From a piano composition standpoint for sure, but of course he didn't compose orchestral pieces like Liszt could (although there that missing orchestral piece in B that just might point out otherwise). He made Liszt really nervous, and I'm fairly sure no one else did that.

The reason I became familiar with Alkan is actually through an orchestral composition, the two chamber concertos - the orchestra writing is of a good standard, but yes youre right there is not enough of him to make a judgement.

As I said before, recordings cannot be a subjective judge because the standards of Liszt's time era differs too much from our standards today. If he had left any recordings, they would most likely be full of personal embellishments, so much so that we may not even recognize the piece he is performing. (As I said before, Liszt would only play a piece as written the first time he sight-read it)

I know a fellow from another forum who is an avid pianophile. After years of collecting historical recordings, he has grown accustomed to the "romantic" style of Rosenthal, Paderewski, Friedman, and such but to many of our ears, the recordings (especially of Paderewski) leave us merely curious and confused. Now go back 50 more years, and you have Liszt, Chopin, Henselt, Herz, Thalberg, Mendelssohn. You get the point.

But what we do have is primary sources (see my original post). The reputation of a pianist like Liszt, Tausig, Thalberg, Henselt, Alkan, D'Albert, Clementi, Hummel, Mendelssohn, and A.Rubinstein is backed by a continuous amount of primary sources. Remember that history is backed by primary sources alone, there was no technology to prove one thing or another.

Which is why, by the way, religious texts are such a problem to some people. But that is another debate for another forum.

What is it that makes Liszt have such a divine authority as the greatest pianist in the minds of so many? Don't basically all of us here know full well that several others wrote pieces more difficult than that of Liszt?

I've heard several recordings of Bartok, and think he is incredible, just as good as Liszt is reputed to be, and in several different genres of music to boot. Liszt said that Alkan was his technical superior (and Alkan was also known as an incredibly sensitive interpreter of music), Sofronitzky certainly seems just as good in my eyes, Richter is a technical master, Michaelangeli is a human metronome and super perfectionist, Marc Andre Hamelin is similar to Michaelangeli, Cziffra was an interpretive genius, Rubinstein was a very noble and well rounded pianist, and so on for several more names. Why is it that we mystify the name of Liszt? I think we all know that the people in France at that time had a way of overstating things, and obviously were superficial enough in their studies of music to view much of Liszt's purely technical works (that he admitted himself to be only the work of a young gun of a showman) as the highest order of good music.

Liszt was a very great pianist, but how do we know whether or not Thalberg was much better than him? He was simply a cultural phenomenon of the times.

Those two did have a showdown at some point and apparently Liszt "won." Go figure. Don't bother me about how one can be the judge of that. :rolleyes:

It's interesting how we're interested in who is the greatest pianist (or violinist), but no-one cares about who is greatest at the less popular instruments. I mean, does anyone talk about who is the greatest violist, bassoonist or organist?

I really don't think there is anybody that the whole world will say is the best. Everybody will have a different opinion. Some days I cant decide whether I think Mozart is the best composer or Beethoven is. I think everybody has their way of being the best. Too many composers and musicians for their to be a definitive artist.

Most people think Yngwie Malmsteen is a guitar god, but I think his playing is to robotic. Some say Jascha Heifetz was the best violinist of all time, but I think Augustin Dumay is just as good. Some say Picasso's paintings are beautiful, but I can't ever decide what I am looking at.

I think this is a hard question to answer.
I know that I will never be able to hear how pianist from the 1700s to 1800s sounds compared to those who are living today or a pianist from the 2200s(I highly doubt that I will live that long), but I know that I like Arthur Rubinsteins piano playing among others.
So I guess this is a case of each to his own.

Artur Rubinstein is among my favourite pianists. To me he played with more charm and warmth than Horowitz, a major contemporary.

Rubinstein and Chopin were made for each other. But as you are a Mozart fan you may be aware of other artists who are especially highly regarded playing his piano works. For the main Piano Concertos (nos 19-27) people like Ashkenazy and Barenboim stand out very well. Among the piano sonatas pianists like Mitsuko Uchida, Alfred Brendel, Murray Perahia, Maria Joao-Pires, Lilli Krauss are very impressive.

These artists all play using modern pianos. If you would like to listen to a more "period" approach of Mozart's piano works based on the use of a fortepiano then some good names to look out for are Ronald Brautigam and Malcolm Bilson.

Well here's my list. It's just few from the top of my head, so don't be offended if your favorite's not my favorite.

Pre-20th century pianists:

Liszt-
No need to elaborate.

Alkan-
A close friend of Chopin, and indeed a rival of Liszt, Alkan was certainly one of the greatest pianists of all time. Liszt confessed that Alkan had the greatest technique he had ever witnessed. His Etudes and Concerti for Solo Piano are a testament to his capabilities with the instrument.

Scriabin-
Scriabin was widely accepted to be one of the greatest pianists of his time, and was praised for the colorful and sensual elements of his sound. Known sometimes as a "Russian Chopin", Scriabin lived up to this title in both his early compositions (ex. Valse, Op. 1, Etude, Op. 2 No. 1), and his performing abilities.

20th century Pianists:

Vladimir Horowitz-
His technical proficiency was absolutely fantastic. Though not without flaw, he is (in my opinion) inarguably the greatest interpreter. He was a man of outstanding musicality, humility, and humanity, and for that he goes down as my number one. A couple examples of exceptional recordings: Scriabin, Op. 42 no. 5, Etude in C# minor. Similarly, his recordings of Rachmaninoff preludes are simply divine. The recording that introduced me to this great man was Mozart's 23rd piano concerto, specifically the second movement. Perhaps more beautiful than the recording himself is watching him afterword speaking with other humans. The human element is all too often forgotten.

Sviatoslav Richter-
Richter's ability to play a piece while holding the composer's intentions above his own was fantastic. interpretation, so to speak, is minimal, and he follows the directions of the composer religiously. His recordings are perhaps the closest to achieving the intentions of the composer. Specific examples would be his recordings of the Debussy Estampes in his later years, and similar to Horowitz, his recordings of the Rachmaninoff preludes.

Glenn Gould-
Any list of the greats should include Gould. Love him or hate him, one must admit that his technique was absolutely impeccable. The name Gould is rightfully inseparable from the name Bach, and his recordings of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Inventions are, in my eyes, the authoritative interpretations. Likewise, his recordings of the Goldberg Variations are fantastic. He was a strange, yet handsome and charming pianist. Oddly eccentric, but nonetheless deeply attached and in love with the music which he played. His documentaries record a the world through the eyes of a man who saw music everywhere, and I truly believe he was a genius.

Marc-Andre Hamelin-
Hamelin has gained my appreciation recently for the attention he pays to the composers that have slid to the periphery of the repertoire. He performs Alkan's Etudes with amazing proficiency, and even if you don't like them, his recordings of Roslavets are a significant achievement worthy of praise.

Horowitz at time got a bit showy and would change a few compositions...added a few octaves here and there. It's happened it a quite a few of his recordings I've heard.

I love Martha Argerich. She plays wonderfully. At times, it can be a bit frantic...but for the most part, it's good stuff. On the opposite end, Van Cliburn tends to drag his feet...but I love his playing too.
